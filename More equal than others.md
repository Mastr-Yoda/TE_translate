>> A year of Euro-summits will reveal much about China’s worldview

>> 今年的欧洲峰会将会显现出中国的世界观。

If judged by words, rather than deeds, China is the world’s most powerful supporter of European unity. At a time when populist leaders such as President Donald Trump barely conceal their scorn for the European Union and other multilateral institutions, China talks of deepening and strengthening ties with the EU and other international bodies dear to Europeans.

如果只看说的不看做的，中国是欧洲联合的最大支持者。当美国总统特朗普这样的民粹分子几乎不掩饰他们对欧盟或者其他多边合作组织的蔑视的时候，中国强调加强与欧盟以及其他国际组织的深入合作。

Their great nation’s rise is powered by globalisation, Chinese officials explain. That gives China cause to fear anti-European populism that often overlaps with hostility to trade. As a result, it wants to work with all of Europe on crafting a fairer, more just, multilateral order fit for the 21st century.

中国的发展很大上程度得益于全球化，中国官方这样解释。这使得中国有理由担心经常与贸易敌对情绪交织的反欧盟民粹主义。所以，中国想要与欧洲共同努力，制定出一个适合21世纪的更公平，更公正的多边秩序。

There are reasons to be sceptical of such pledges. Start with core principles. China’s worldview is built on absolute deference to state sovereignty, chin-jutting nationalism and a belief that one country should not meddle in the internal affairs of another. In contrast, the belief that small and mid-sized countries can gain by pooling some sovereignty is the EU’s founding idea. Meddling in members’ affairs, to defend inviolable norms, is the union’s point.

有理由怀疑这样的承诺。以核心原则为出发点。中国的世界观建立在绝对尊重国家主权，意志坚定的民族主义的信念上，以及一个国家不应该干涉别国内政的信念上。相反，欧盟的创始理念则是中小国家通过集中一些主权能够获益。插手成员国的事务来捍卫不可侵犯的规范，是欧盟的观点。

This year will test China’s commitment to Europe in deeds, as well as words. Twice in 2020 the country’s leader, President Xi Jinping, will meet European counterparts at summits. The largest
will take place in September in Leipzig, co-hosted by Germany and the EU. With Britain out of the club by then, Mr Xi will meet 27 national leaders, alongside the heads of Euro-institutions. European diplomats talk of a meeting of equals: two economic giants discussing such goals as a long-stalled agreement on two-way investments, or action on climate change, and all at a time when America’s commitment to international co-operation is in doubt. Even the place, in former East Germany, sends a message, it is said. Germany’s chancellor, Angela Merkel, wants to show China that western and ex-communist EU members stand as one.

今年将会在言行上检验中国对欧洲的承诺。2020年，中国国家主席习近平将与欧洲领导人进行两次峰会。最大的峰会将会在九月份，在莱比锡由德国和欧盟联合举行。那时英国已经完成脱欧，习先生将与欧洲机构负责人会见27国领导人。欧洲外交官声称这是一个公平的会晤：两个经济巨头会讨论长期被搁置的，诸如双向投资或者应对气候变化之类的目标。与此同时，美国在国际合作上的承诺却让人怀疑。甚至是会议的地址，前东德地区，都释放了一个信息。德国总理，安吉拉·默克尔，想给中国展现一个西欧和前社会主义的欧盟成员能够团结在一起。

China has a counter-message. In April it will host a summit of a grouping known as “17+1”. Founded in 2012, the club brings together China and 12 EU members—Bulgaria, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Greece, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia; and five aspiring ones—Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro, North Macedonia and Serbia. Recent years have seen growing discontent among EU members of the group. Most have not seen hoped-for Chinese investments in bridges, roads and other infrastructure, and their farm goods and other products still struggle to enter China’s markets. Detecting trouble, China upgraded this year’s 17+1 summit. It is to be hosted in Beijing by Mr Xi, rather than the prime minister, Li Keqiang, who has presided over the group’s meetings to date.

中国有一个对冲的消息。今年四月份，中国将举办“17+1”峰会。这个峰会创建于2012年，是中国与12个欧盟国家--保加利亚，克罗地亚，捷克共和国，爱沙尼亚，希腊，匈牙利，拉脱维亚，立陶宛，波兰，罗马尼亚，斯洛伐克以及斯洛文尼亚；和5个意向加入欧盟的国家--阿尔巴尼亚，波斯尼亚和黑塞哥维那，黑山共和国，北马其顿和塞尔维亚。近些年，这个组织中的欧盟成员国之间开始产生不满。多数看不到中国投资桥梁，道路和其他基础设施的希望，并且他们的农产品和其他商品仍然难以进入中国市场。看到这些问题，中国更新了今年的17+1峰会。这个峰会将会在北京由习先生主持，而不是之前一直负责主持这个会议的总理李克强。
