> A year of Euro-summits will reveal much about China’s worldview
> 今年的欧洲峰会将会显现出中国的世界观。

If judged by words, rather than deeds, China is the world’s most powerful supporter of European unity. At a time when populist leaders such as President Donald Trump barely conceal their scorn for the European Union and other multilateral institutions, China talks of deepening and strengthening ties with the EU and other international bodies dear to Europeans.
如果只看说的不看做的，中国是欧洲联合的最大支持者。当美国总统特朗普这样的民粹分子几乎不掩饰他们对欧盟或者其他多边合作组织的蔑视的时候，中国强调加强与欧盟以及其他国际组织的深入合作。
