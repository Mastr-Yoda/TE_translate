# How bad will it get?  
# 情况会变多糟？

### The coronavirus is likely to become a pandemic. That need not be as catastrophic as it sounds  
### 新冠状病毒可能回边城全球范围的流行病。不过不会变得像听起来那么糟糕。  

Two things explain why a new infectious disease is so alarming. One is that, at first, it spreads exponentially. As tens of cases become hundreds and hundreds become thousands, the mathematics run away with you, conjuring speculation about a health-care collapse, social and economic upheaval and a deadly pandemic. The other is profound uncertainty. Sparse data and conflicting reports mean that scientists cannot rule out the worst case—and that lets bad information thrive.  

两个事情能够解释为什么一个新的传染病是如此值得警惕。一个是，首先，它以指数方式传播。十个病患边城数百个病患，然后再变为数千个。数字越来越大，卫生保健系统崩溃，社会经济动荡以及致死的全球流行病这样的想象，像幽灵一般地出现在你的大脑。另一个是巨大的不确定性。稀疏的数据和相互矛盾的报告，意味着科学家也没有办法排除最坏的情况。这使得坏消息泛滥。  

So it is with a new coronavirus, known as 2019-ncov, which has struck in China. The number of reported cases grew from 282 on January 20th to almost 7,800 just nine days later. In that time four reported cases outside mainland China have multiplied to 105 in 19 territories. Doubt clouds fundamental properties of the disease, including how it is passed on and what share of infected people die. Amid the uncertainty, a simulation of a coronavirus outbreak by Johns Hopkins University in October, in which 65m people lost their lives, was put about as a prediction. It is not.  

2019新型冠状病毒（2019-ncov）席卷了中国。报告的确诊病例数从1月20日的282例，仅仅九天时间就增长到了7800例。与此同时，中国大陆境外的报告确诊人数也从4例增长到了105例，在19个国家和地区。关于这个疾病的基础数据，包括传播途径和致死率，变成为人们关注的疑点。在不确定性中，十月份约翰霍普金斯大学对冠状病毒的模拟实验被到处传播，这个模拟实验的结果是650万人死亡。但事实不是这样。  

Those are the right questions, though: will the new virus become a global disease? And how deadly will it be? A definite answer is weeks or months away, but public-health authorities have to plan today. The best guess is that the disease has taken hold in China (see China section) and there is a high risk that it spreads around the world—it may even become a recurrent seasonal infection. It may turn out to be no more lethal than seasonal influenza, but that would still count as serious (see International section). In the short term that would hit the world economy and, depending on how the outbreak is handled, it could also have political effects in China.  

不过那些都是正确的问题：新病毒会变成全球疾病吗？它的致死率是多少？一个肯定的答复是，它将持续几周或者几个月。但是公共卫生部门需要应对当前的局面。最好的猜测是，这个病毒在中国境内被控制住，它有很高的风险传播到全世界甚至变成反复出现的季节性流行病。它的死亡率可能变得比季节性流感更低，但是世界对此仍然十分重视。短期内，这将影响世界经济，还可能影响到中国的政治，这取决于中国政府如何处理这个突发事件。  

The outbreak began in December. The repeated mingling of people and animals in China means that viral mutations that infect humans are likely to arise there; and mass migration to cities means that they are likely to spread between people. This virus probably originated in bats and passed through mammals, such as palm civets or ferret badgers, ending up in Wuhan’s wet market, where wild animals were on sale. Symptoms resemble flu, but can include pneumonia, which may be fatal. About 20% of reported cases are severe, and need hospital care; about 2% of them have been fatal. As yet, there is no vaccine or antiviral treatment.  

这起突发事件起源于十二月。在中国，人和动物的反复接触导致了病毒变异。大量人口在城市的聚集导致人与人之间传播。这个病毒可能起源于蝙蝠，借由其他动物，比如果子狸或者鼬獾传播给人。这个过程发生在武汉海鲜市场。这个市场贩卖野生动物。症状看起来像流感，但是能够引起致命的肺炎。大约20%的报告病例病情严重需要去医院接受治疗。大约2%的人死亡。目前还没有疫苗或者对应的治疗。

The greatest uncertainty is how many cases have gone unrecorded. Primary health care is rudimentary in China and some of the ill either avoided or were turned away from busy hospitals. Many more may have such mild symptoms that they do not realise they have the disease. Modelling by academics in Hong Kong suggests that, as of January 25th, tens of thousands of people have already been infected and that the epidemic will peak in a few months’ time. If so, the virus is more widespread than thought, and hence will be harder to contain within China. But it will also prove less lethal, because the number of deaths should be measured against a much larger base of infections. As with flu, a lot of people could die nonetheless. In 2017-18 a bad flu season saw symptoms in 45m Americans, and 61,000 deaths.

最大的不确定性是到底有多少感染者未被记录。基本医疗卫生条件在中国还比较原始。一些疾病没有得到遏制。许多患者是没有明显症状的感染者。香港科学院建模分析说，根据1月25日的数据，上万人已经被感染了，这场疫情的顶峰在几个月之后。如果真是这样的话，这个病毒将比我们想象中传播的更广，因此更难把病毒遏制在中国境内。但是也能证明这个病毒的致死率更低，因为死亡人数除以更大的感染人数。流感也会造成大量死亡。2017年到2018年，严重的流感导致4500万美国人感染，61000人死亡。

Scientists have started work on vaccines and on treatments to make infections less severe. These are six to 12 months away, so the world must fall back on public-health measures. In China that has led to the biggest quarantine in history, as Wuhan and the rest of Hubei province have been sealed off. The impact of such draconian measures has rippled throughout China. The spring holiday has been extended, keeping schools and businesses closed. The economy is running on the home-delivery of food and goods.

科学家已经开始研发疫苗和治疗方法来缓解疫情。但是这需要6到12个月的时间。所以世界必须依靠公共健康措施。中国已经采取了历史上最大范围的隔离措施，武汉和湖北省的其他城市已经被封锁。如此严酷的措施，已经扩散到整个中国。春节假期被延长，保持学校和商业机构关闭。经济活动依赖送到家的快递。

Many experts praise China’s efforts. Certainly, its scientists have coped better with the Wuhan virus than they did with SARS in 2003, rapidly detecting it, sequencing its genome, licensing diagnostic kits and informing international bodies. China’s politicians come off less well. They left alone the cramped markets filled with wild animals that spawned SARS. With the new virus, local officials in Wuhan first played down the science and then, when the disease had taken hold, enacted the draconian quarantine fully eight hours after announcing it, allowing perhaps 1m potentially infectious people to leave the city first.

许多研究机构表扬中国作出的努力。当然，中国科学家对于武汉新冠状病毒的研究比2003年的SARS更好，他们马上就分离出病毒，测序了病毒的基因，制定出了诊断方法并提供给世界其他国家。中国的政客们表现欠佳。他们在SARS之后，仍然保留了出售野生动物的市场。在这次疫情中，武汉当地政府首先无视科学，他们在声明这场疫情八小时之后才颁布了严格的隔离措施。那时疫情已经扩散了。导致一百万潜在的受感染者离开了武汉。

That may have undermined a measure which is taking a substantial toll. China’s growth in the first quarter could fall to as little as 2%, from 6% before the outbreak. As China accounts for almost a fifth of world output, there will probably be a noticeable dent on global growth. Though the economy will bounce back when the virus fades, the reputation of the Communist Party and even of Xi Jinping may be more lastingly affected (see Chaguan). The party claims that, armed with science, it is more efficient at governing than democracies. The heavy-handed failure to contain the virus suggests otherwise.

这可能已经破坏了一项正在付出巨大代价的措施。中国经济一季度增长可能从疫情爆发之前的6%降到2%。由于中国经济占世界的五分之一，世界经济发展可能受到显著的影响。尽管经济会在疫情之后重新反弹，对共c党和XJ平的影响将会持续很长时间。共c党生成，用科学武装，它比民主国家在执政方面更有效率。严重的无法控制的病毒表明情况并非如此。

Outside China such quarantines are unthinkable. The medical and economic cost will depend on governments slowing the disease’s spread. The way to do this is by isolating cases as soon as they crop up and tracing and quarantining people that victims have been in contact with—indeed, if the disease burns out in China, that might yet stop the pandemic altogether. If, by contrast, that proves inadequate, they could shut schools, discourage travel and urge the cancellation of public events. Buying time in this way has advantages even if it does not completely stop the disease. Health-care systems would have a greater chance to prepare for the onslaught, and to empty beds that are now full of people with seasonal flu.

在中国之外，这样的封锁措施是无法想象的。付出多少医疗和经济代价取决于政府阻止疫情扩散的速度。如果疫情发生在中国，阻止其扩散的方法包括：一旦发现发病者就将他隔离，并追踪隔离密切接触的人。这样能有效阻止疾病的大爆发。如果发现这样的措施无效，他们就关闭学校，不鼓励人员流动，叫停公共活动。即使不能完全阻止疾病，以这种方式购买时间也具有优势。卫生系统将会有更大的机会应对这场突发疫情，并且准备出更多床位。这些床位现在正被患季节性流感的病人占满。

Despite all those efforts the epidemic could still be severe. Some health systems, in Africa and the slums of Asia’s vast cities, will not be able to isolate patients and trace contacts. Much depends on whether people are infectious when their symptoms are mild (or before they show any at all, as some reports suggest), because such people are hard to spot. And also on whether the virus mutates to become more transmissible or lethal.

尽管有这些努力，但是这场疫情仍然可能会很严重。因为一些国家的卫生系统可能难以隔离病人并追踪接触者，比如非洲和亚洲大城市的贫民窟。还因为有些被感染的人的症状很轻微（或者想一些报道说的，他们之前没有任何症状），这些人是很难被找出来的。而且这个病毒还可能变异成更具传染性或者更致命。

The world has never responded as rapidly to a disease as it has to 2019-nCOV. Even so, the virus may still do great harm. As humans encroach on new habitats, farm more animals, gather in cities, travel and warm the planet, new diseases will become more common. One estimate puts their cost at $60bn a year. SARS, MERS, Nipah, Zika, Mexican swine flu: the fever from Wuhan is the latest of a bad bunch. It will not be the last. 

世界应对疾病，从没有像应对2019-nCOV病毒这么快。尽管这样，这个病毒仍然可能造成很大的破坏。随着人类侵占了更多土地，养殖了更多动物，聚集在城市，满世界旅行并且导致气候变暖，新的疾病将会变得更频繁。有人估计人类每年要花费600亿美元应对这些。SARS病毒，MERS病毒，尼帕病毒，寨卡病毒，墨西哥猪流感：武汉的这场疫情是最新的一次爆发。但它不会是最后一个。
